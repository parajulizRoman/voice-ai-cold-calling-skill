# Meta AI + GHL Conversation Monitoring Architecture

## The Problem

Meta bans third-party auto-reply bots on Instagram/Messenger. They've introduced their own AI automated services. You can't replace Meta's AI — but you CAN augment it with official API access.

## The Architecture

```
Customer messages on Instagram/Messenger
        │
        ▼
Meta's Native AI handles first (FAQ, greetings, basic replies)
        │
        ├── AI handles it → done, logged to CRM via GHL
        │
        └── AI can't answer → ESCALATION TRIGGER
                │
                ▼
        GHL Conversations monitors for escalation signals
                │
                ▼
        Qritim AI agent jumps in via official API
                │
                ▼
        Updates CRM pipeline (lead stage, tags, notes, conversation history)
```

## Escalation Triggers (what to watch for)

Keywords that signal Meta AI failed:
- "speak to human"
- "that's not right"
- "I need help with"
- "can I talk to someone"
- "not what I asked"
- "real person"
- More than 3 back-and-forth messages without resolution

## GHL Workflow Prompt

```
Build a conversation monitoring workflow that:

1. TRIGGER: When a new message arrives from Instagram or Messenger in Conversations.

2. CHECK: If message contains "speak to human", "that's not right", "I need help with", "can I talk to someone", "not what I asked", or if conversation has 3+ back-and-forth messages without resolution — route to Qritim AI agent.

3. AI HANDLING: Qritim AI responds naturally, continuing from where Meta AI left off. Opening: "Hey, I noticed the automated system couldn't quite help with that. I'm here to take over — what can I help you with?"

4. CRM UPDATE: After each conversation:
   - Add tag: "Lead - Pricing", "Lead - Service Question", "Support - Issue"
   - Move pipeline stage: New Lead → Engaged → Qualified → Hot Lead
   - Add internal note with conversation summary

5. FALLBACK: If Qritim AI can't resolve, tag "Needs Human" and create task for follow-up within 2 hours.

6. WEEKLY REPORT: Auto-summary every Monday: conversations handled by Meta AI, escalated to Qritim AI, needing human, new leads added.
```

## Compliance Note

This setup is compliant because:
- Meta AI = Meta's own tool (fully allowed)
- Qritim AI = via official Instagram/Messenger API, marked as business account
- Human fallback always available

Do NOT use unauthorized third-party auto-responders. That's what gets accounts banned.
